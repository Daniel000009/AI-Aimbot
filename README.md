## About

Lunar can be modified to work with a variety of FPS games; however, it is currently configured for Fortnite. Besides being general purpose, the main advantage of using Lunar is that it does not meddle with the memory of other processes.

Lunar LITE uses [YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
